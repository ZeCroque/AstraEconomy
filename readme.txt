### 1. SUMMARY

This mods add more dialogs to Stache from the Tracker Alliance's HQ that will give you the opportunity to reroll your legendary gear and trade your unwanted legendaries for Astras, thus reducing the grind to get the legendary item you seek for.
It does basically two things :
- Stache now asks you to give him a item to modify, and will reroll the legendary effect of the wanted level (only this one, unless lower tiers weren't yet set).
- You can now trade legendary gear to Stache and it will give you Astra(s) based on the "star level" of what you gave. 3 stars in whatever combination of item <=> 1 Astra. If the "star level" of the items you gave isn't a multiple of 3, you will be given back the surplus.

That's a pretty simple mod, but I find it much more convenient than what BGS provided while not being as OP as other Legendary cycling/crafting mods out there that were breaking the gameplay loop IMHO.

Note that you cannot get legendary effects combination that were not possible in the base game, so no Peacemaker suit or explosive Arc Welder, sorry for you cheater out there :p I may add some customization options later on though, depending of the success of the mod and what the community wants, so feel free to ask in the comment section :)

PS : You may notice, before the screen fades to black when cycling items, that the said items are dropped to the ground before being processed by the mod (you hear them too). Infortunately it was the only way I got it to work, because the script function I was wanting to use, *GetItemCountKeywords*, is not working properly. If any modders there have a better solution, I'm listening!

### 2. MOD CONTENT

This mod is made of two files : 
- *AstraEconomy.esm*
- *AstraEconomy - Main.ba2*

This mod is flagged as Light file, so it won't waste a precious place in your load order.

### 3. INSTALLATION

**Automatic (Recommended)**
- Use the Mod Manager Download button. Install and enable the file(s) in your favorite mod manager (ModOrganizer2 is my personal preference).

If you start the game inside the Tracker Alliance's HQ, you'll have to go out and enter again to get the new dialogs.
